Each pokemon card is a <li> added programatically after loading the initial html. At the moment, the function loadPokemonItens requests a batch of pokemons to the api, converts them into <li>'s and adds them all at once to the DOM. This last part has to change, we need to convert one pokemon to a <li>, add it to the DOM, add to it the event handler that shows the modal and then move to the next.
